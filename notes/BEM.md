# BEM

BEM stand for Block Element Modifier. And this method is used to give class names to elements. When we say components(the parts of our application can be using on its own) and element is any part of that component but doesn't make sense by itself. But modifier is used to change their styles or etc. And this method is used as below:

```
block__element--modifier
```

If our class name parts consist of 2 words we write them as below

```
block-first__element-first--modifier.
```

for example

```
.recipe
.recipe__stat-name
.recipe__stat-name--small
```
